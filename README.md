# Bot5

P5 + ML5 + Robot

## Quick Start

Open this [p5.js web editor sketch](https://editor.p5js.org/momoe-nomoto/sketches/8lOIc2r0O) with bot5.js added.

## Examples

1. [Turtle](https://editor.p5js.org/Siyuan-Yu/sketches/kAwT1or2N)

Using the screen, it shows a 'bot' on the canvas and it draws with pressing keys and changing colors of the trace. Bot5 moves with your onscreen 'bot'.

2. [Music Show](https://editor.p5js.org/momoe-nomoto/sketches/IO_mZXL61)

P5 will play an animation and a music file and the bot will move in a pre-programmed sequence, dancing around, and clapping at the end.

3. [Space Invaders](https://editor.p5js.org/momoe-nomoto/sketches/bbOMA3S8R)

Using the IMU we can control a video game that can be played by turning the controller and pressing a button.

4. [Burglar Alarm](https://editor.p5js.org/momoe-nomoto/sketches/qQlh8yy8r)

Using the IMU, we can play something on the screen once the IMU position changes.

5. [Clock Alarm](https://editor.p5js.org/momoe-nomoto/sketches/ojOgO9Vrs)

Using the buzzer and the movements, bot5 can wake you up once a certain time is reached, in a similar way to Clocky. 

6. [No More TV](https://editor.p5js.org/momoe-nomoto/sketches/okq3yo4IE)

We can turn the bot into a moving remote control. Using the on screen joystick we can move the bot and we can use the infrared transmitter to send “OFF” commands to TVs.

7. [Space Exploration](https://editor.p5js.org/momoe-nomoto/sketches/2A-2txtNN)

Using an ultrasonic sensor, we can draw the surroundings on the screen as radar and we can navigate using a control similar to Turtle.

8. IoT Toilette Paper Dispenser

Using a QR code on the screen, we can make a useless invention that can be accessed through the on-board web server.

9. [Pet Training](https://editor.p5js.org/momoe-nomoto/sketches/TCazky67P)

Using spoken commands, we can teach “stupid pet tricks” to the bot that will be performed.

10. [Dance With Me](https://editor.p5js.org/momoe-nomoto/sketches/PCEsJ2NKG)

Using ML5 to recognize pose, we can let the bot move the wheels following the hand movements.
